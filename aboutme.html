      <p>  I am a girl who loves to bake. That is how this whole blog got started. After spending so much time soaking up what I saw on other food blogs, I realized that what I was really itching to do was start my own. 
	  Fast forward to the present and that little spark of inspiration has become a whole wildfire of inspiration in my life.
Because baking in particular is my thing, you will mostly find baked goods on this blog. breads, muffins, pastries, rolls, cakes, etc. but you will also find a few other types of recipes that I dabble in smoothies, no-bake goodies, and the like.
 The more time I spend in the kitchen, the more I learn, which means that I am constantly coming up with new recipes I want to share. In short, what I produce in the kitchen, you will likely find here. And my promise (which I hope I never break!) is that every recipe will always be 100% from scratch. 
 That is the way I was raised, and that is the kind of baking I believe in.

<p>The Little Cale Co. is a community of bakers and cake lovers. If youâ€™re looking for beautiful cake inspiration, projects, tutorials and recipes -- you have come to the right place.</br>Making cakes like these might seem like an ageless tradition, but actually this type of light, airy cake is a relatively new invention.

The first skilled bakers were probably the ancient Egyptians. At this time cakes were basically breads, with egg, fat and honey added to create the recognisable essence of cake: richness and sweetness. The earliest English cakes were still essentially bread, their main distinguishing characteristics being their shape round and flat and that they were hard on both sides as a result of being turned during baking.

Cakes as we know them today only came on the scene during the 18th and 19th centuries when the lightness created by the leavening power of yeast was replaced, first by eggs, and then by chemical raising agents such as bicarbonate of soda. Raising agents provided a greater leavening power than yeast with much less time and effort.</p>
